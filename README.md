# Car_purchase_amount
## Car purchase amount using ANN (artificial neural network)

In the notebook below I analyzed and evaluated the expected amount (in $) a customer is willing to pay in a car purchase deal using attributes such as age, gender, annual income, overall debt, etc.

you'll find concise steps of data cleaning and visualizing followed by more elaborated and experimental steps of building and testing a few different NNs differentiating by # of neurons, # of epochs, and batch size to reduce loss to a minimum.

The notebook below is written using Jupyter Notebook using basic ML packages (numpy, sklearn, numpy, pyplot) and Tensorflow with Kera for building the NN.
